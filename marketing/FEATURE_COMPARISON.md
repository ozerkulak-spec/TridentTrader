## Market Positioning

### Premium Tier ($50-100/month)
**Competitors**: LuxAlgo, Zeiierman, Flux Charts, BigBeluga

**Trident's Advantage**:
- More comprehensive (triple confluence)
- Better risk management tools
- Clearer interface
- Superior documentation

**Target**: Serious traders willing to invest in quality tools

---

### Mid-Tier ($20-50/month)

## Pricing Strategy Rationale

### Why $79/month?

1. **Below LuxAlgo** ($80-100) but **above smaller players** ($40-60)
   - Positioned as "premium but accessible"

2. **Psychological pricing**: $79 feels significantly less than $80+
   - Studies show $79 converts better than $80

3. **Annual discount (37% off)**: Aggressive enough to drive long-term commitments
   - Competitors typically offer 20-30% annual discounts
   - Our 37% stands out

4. **Launch pricing**: Room to increase to $99/month after 500 users
   - Creates urgency ("lock in your price now")
