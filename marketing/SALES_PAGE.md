# 🔱 TRIDENT TRADER SUITE

Language: EN | [TR](./SALES_PAGE_TR.md)

## The Only TradingView Indicator You'll Ever Need

### Triple Confluence. One Clear Signal. Maximum Consistency.

---

## 🎯 What is Trident Trader?

**Trident Trader** is a premium, all-in-one TradingView indicator that combines three powerful analytical methods into a single, easy-to-use system:

1. **Trend Following** – Know the market direction with precision
2. **Momentum Analysis** – Time your entries perfectly
3. **Liquidity Zones** – Trade from institutional support & resistance

Unlike other indicators that focus on just one aspect, Trident Trader gives you **triple confirmation** before every signal – dramatically increasing your win rate and confidence.

---

## 🚀 Why Trident Trader Stands Out

### The Problem with Most Indicators

- **Too many false signals** – leaving you frustrated and down money
- **No risk management** – you don't know where to place stops or take profits
- **One-dimensional analysis** – missing the bigger picture
- **Confusing to use** – cluttered charts with conflicting information
- **No support** – you're left to figure it out alone

### The Trident Solution

✅ **High-Probability Signals** – Only alerts you when Trend + Momentum + Liquidity align  
✅ **Automatic Risk Calculation** – Every signal comes with pre-calculated stop-loss and take-profit levels  
✅ **Three-Dimensional Analysis** – See the complete market picture in one glance  
✅ **Crystal-Clear Interface** – Clean signals, intuitive dashboard, no clutter  
✅ **Full Support & Community** – Join thousands of successful traders using Trident  

Tip: Prefer tighter filtering? Use Trident PRO (see below) with ADX chop filter, volatility gate, and MTF confirmation.
